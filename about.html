            <h3>Civil Engineer</h3>
            <p>Hi, I am Mohammad Mohsin, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Civil Engineering from
                Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET), where I earned a CGPA of 3.53 out of 4.00. I
                have consistently pursued academic excellence, achieving a GPA of 5.00 (out of 5) in both my HSC (2019)
                from Govt. City College and SSC (2017) from Bakolia Govt. High School. <br> <br>

                Alongside my academic focus, I have developed a strong interest in data science and its applications in
                civil engineering. My research interests include sustainable construction materials and the use of
                machine learning to address challenges in civil engineering. I have gained experience in data
                visualization, statistical analysis, and multidisciplinary research, with a passion for integrating
                advanced technologies like AI and data science to create innovative, real-world solutions. <br><br>

                I have actively participated in national competitions and conferences, including serving as team leader
                and finalist at Thinktank Triumph, The Odyssey 2025, and the Hult Prize at CUET 2025. I also presented
                my work on Seasonal Weather Pattern Prediction Using Machine Learning at the 7th International
                Conference on Advances in Civil Engineering (ICACE) in 2024. In addition, I completed study projects on
                the engineering classification of soils in South Khulshi and the water quality of Chaktai Khal, which
                strengthened my practical knowledge and research skills.</p>

                <h3>Engineering Classification of Soils at A Selected Location within The Chattogram Metropolitan Area
                    (South Khulshi near Road No. 1)</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of the Environmental Engineering (Sessional - I) coursework (Course Code: CE-352), I
                    collaborated with my lab mates on a detailed study to assess the water quality of Chaktai Khal, an
                    essential canal in Chittagong, Bangladesh. <br> <br>
                    Our study revealed significant insights into the water quality of Chaktai Khal:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The pH of 6.98 indicates that the water is nearly neutral but slightly acidic.</li>
                    <li>Turbidity was measured at 65 NTU, indicating a high presence of suspended particles. This was
                        supported by the high levels of Total Solids (TS), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Total
                        Dissolved Solids (TDS), with TSS accounting for 65% of TS, posing filtration challenges.</li>
                    <li>The water contained 8.8 mg/L of free CO <sub>2</sub>, aligning with typical surface water
                        levels.</li>
                    <li>Alkalinity (280 mg/L) exceeded hardness (28 mg/L), indicating temporary (carbonate) hardness
                        that can be removed through heating.</li>
                    <li>High concentrations of chloride and iron were detected, along with uncountable total coliform
                        (TC) and fecal coliform (FC) levels, signaling severe sewage contamination.</li>
                    <li>Elevated BOD and COD levels further indicate significant pollution from diverse waste sources.
                    </li>
                </ol><br> <br>
                <p>
                    Conclusion: The water quality of Chaktai Khal is poor, heavily impacted by sewage and other
                    pollutants, requiring immediate interventions for rehabilitation. <br> <br>

                <p>
                    As part of the course CE-332: Geotechnical Engineering (Sessional - I), I, along with my lab mates,
                    conducted a detailed study focused on the engineering classification of soils in South Khulshi,
                    Chattogram. This project emphasized understanding the fundamental role of soil properties in
                    construction projects, particularly regarding stability, settlement, and structural performance.
